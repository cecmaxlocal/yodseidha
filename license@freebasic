Of course. The licensing for FreeBASIC is a key aspect of the project and is designed to be very flexible for developers.

Here is a breakdown of the FreeBASIC license model.

### The Short Answer (TL;DR)

FreeBASIC uses a **dual-license model** to separate the compiler from the programs it creates:

1.  **The Compiler (`fbc.exe`):** Licensed under the **GNU GPL** (General Public License).
2.  **The Runtime & Standard Libraries (`libfb.a`, etc.):** Licensed under the **GNU LGPL** (Lesser General Public License).

This combination is very common for compilers and is extremely permissive for developers. **Crucially, it allows you to create closed-source, commercial applications without any obligation to release your own source code.**

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. The Compiler - GNU GPL v2

The FreeBASIC compiler itself (`fbc.exe` or `fbc` on Linux/macOS) is distributed under the **GNU General Public License, version 2**.

**What this means:**
*   You are free to download, use, and run the compiler for any purpose (personal, educational, commercial).
*   If you **modify the source code of the compiler itself** and distribute your modified version, you must also release your modifications under the GPL.

> **Key Point:** The GPL license applies *only to the compiler program itself*. It **does not** "infect" or apply to the programs you create *with* the compiler.

#### 2. The Runtime & Standard Libraries - GNU LGPL v2.1

This is the most important part for developers. The code that gets linked into your final executable file (the runtime library that handles functions like `PRINT`, `INPUT`, file I/O, graphics, etc.) is licensed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1**.

The LGPL was specifically designed for libraries to allow them to be used by proprietary (closed-source) software.

**What this means for you as a developer:**
*   You can create applications for any purpose, including **commercial and closed-source software**.
*   You can sell your application without paying any royalties or fees.
*   You **do not** have to release the source code of your own application.

**Your obligations under the LGPL are minimal:**
1.  **Acknowledge the Library:** You must state that your program uses the FreeBASIC runtime library and that the library is licensed under the LGPL. A note in your "About" box or documentation is sufficient.
2.  **Provide the LGPL License Text:** You must include a copy of the LGPL license text with your application.
3.  **Allow Library Replacement:** You must make it possible for an end-user to replace the FreeBASIC library with a different (e.g., newer or modified) version. This is the core requirement of the LGPL.
    *   **If you use dynamic linking** (linking to a `.dll` or `.so` file), this requirement is automatically met.
    *   **If you use static linking** (the default in FreeBASIC), the standard way to comply is to provide your application's object files (`.o` files) upon request, allowing a user to re-link them with a different version of the library. However, a more common and accepted practice is to simply provide a written offer to supply these object files.

### Summary Table

| Component | License | What it means for your program |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FreeBASIC Compiler** (`fbc.exe`) | **GPL** | You can use it freely. The license only matters if you modify the compiler's source code. |
| **FreeBASIC Libraries** (`libfb.a`) | **LGPL** | You can create **closed-source and commercial** programs. You don't need to release your source code. |
| **Your Program** (your `.bas` code) | **Your Choice** | Your code is your own. You can license it however you wish (e.g., keep it proprietary, or choose an open-source license like MIT, Apache, etc.). |

### In Simple Terms: Can I...?

*   **Can I use FreeBASIC to make a commercial game and sell it?**
    *   **Yes.**

*   **Do I have to release my game's source code if I do?**
    *   **No.**

*   **Do I have to pay anyone to use FreeBASIC?**
    *   **No.** It's free of charge.

*   **Do I have to put a splash screen in my app saying "Made with FreeBASIC"?**
    *   **No.** You only need to mention its use in your documentation or credits and include the LGPL license text.
