Of course. You're likely referring to **GDScript**, the primary scripting language for the **Godot Engine**. People sometimes colloquially call it "Godot Script" or "God Script".

The entire Godot Engine, including the GDScript language, its compiler, and its runtime, is released under the very permissive **MIT License**.

Here is what that means in plain, simple language.

### In Plain English: What the MIT License Means for Godot & GDScript

The MIT license is one of the most simple and permissive open-source licenses. For you as a developer, it means:

*   ✅ **Completely Free:** You can use Godot and GDScript for free, forever. There are no fees, no royalties, and no subscription costs.
*   ✅ **Use for Anything:** You have the freedom to use it for any purpose—commercial, personal, educational, etc. You can create and sell games made with Godot without paying anyone.
*   ✅ **You Own Your Code:** Your game code, your art, and your assets are your own. The license does **not** force you to share your source code. This is a key difference from "copyleft" licenses like the GPL.
*   ✅ **Modify and Distribute:** You can modify the Godot engine's source code itself if you want to. You can also distribute your game or application without any restrictions from the license.

### The *Only* Requirement

The MIT license has just one main condition:

> **You must include the original copyright notice and the license text with your software.**

**How to Comply (The Easy Way):**
When you export your game from Godot, it automatically includes a `_licenses.txt` file that contains the Godot license and licenses for all its third-party components. As long as you ship this file with your game, you have fulfilled your obligation.

Alternatively, many developers add a "Licenses" or "Credits" section within their game's main menu or options screen that displays this information.

### Official License Text

For reference, here is the core of the MIT License that Godot uses.

```

### Summary

| Feature                 | Is it Allowed?                                        |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use for Free**        | **Yes**                                               |
| **Commercial Projects** | **Yes**, you can sell your game and keep all the money. |
| **Keep Your Code Private** | **Yes**, your game's source code is your own.         |
| **Modify the Engine**   | **Yes**                                               |
| **Main Obligation**     | **Include the license text** with your final product. |

In short, the licensing for GDScript (and all of Godot) is extremely developer-friendly and is a major reason for its growing popularity.
