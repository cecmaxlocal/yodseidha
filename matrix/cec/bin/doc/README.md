**`./yodseidha`** is the codename for a comprehensive, cross-platform development ecosystem powered by **IDEBeeScript**. This project aims to provide a unified toolchain for building web, desktop, and mobile applications, all centered around the **Bee** language, a proud member of the **Bird's Languages** family.

## ✨ Philosophy

Our philosophy is inspired by the beehive: a collection of specialized, yet interconnected, components working in harmony to create something powerful. IDEBeeScript is designed to be simple, efficient, and productive, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy with ease across any platform.

##  hives The Hive: Core Components

The `yodseidha` project is a monorepo containing a colony of tools and frameworks. Each directory represents a key part of the ecosystem.

| Component | Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bee** | `./bee/` | The core compiler, interpreter, and runtime for the **IDEBeeScript** language. |
| **Web** | `./web/` | The web framework, client-side libraries, and a web-based IDE for IDEBeeScript. |
| **Desktop** | `./desktop/` | The cross-platform desktop IDE, built to provide the best development experience. |
| **Servers** | `./servers/` | Frameworks and libraries for building high-performance, scalable backend services and APIs. |
| **App** | `./app/` | The mobile development kit for building native iOS and Android applications with IDEBeeScript. |
| **Client** | `./client/` | A universal command-line interface (CLI) and thin clients for interacting with the ecosystem. |
| **Doc** | `./doc/` | All official documentation, guides, and specifications for the entire project. |
| **Image** | `./image/` | Dockerfiles, container images, and asset management tools for deployment and CI/CD. |
| **Bird's Langs** | `(Concept)` | The conceptual group of languages that **Bee** belongs to, promoting interoperability. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/example/yodseidha.git
    cd yodseidha
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**
    This will install dependencies for all sub-projects.
    ```sh
    ./scripts/install-all.sh
    ```

3.  **Build the entire ecosystem:**
    This command will compile the `bee` language, the desktop IDE, and other buildable components.
    ```sh
    ./scripts/build-all.sh
    ```

## Code Example: "Hello, Hive!"

IDEBeeScript is designed to be intuitive and readable. Here is a simple example.

**`hello.bee`**
```beescript
// Import the core library for I/O
import core.io;

// A function in Bee is a 'flower' that produces a result
flower greet(name: String) {
    // 'buzz' is the standard print command
    io.buzz("Hello, ${name} from the IDEBeeScript hive! 🐝");
}

// Call the function
greet("Developer");
```

To run the script:
```sh
./build/bin/bee run examples/hello.bee
```
**Output:**
```
Hello, Developer from the IDEBeeScript hive! 🐝
```
